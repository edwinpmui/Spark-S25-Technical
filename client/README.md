# Chores App

This is a Chores App built with React and Firebase. It allows users to log in, add chores, and manage their chores. I originally wanted to create a chores app specifically designed for roommates, in which tasks can be cycled per person every week (like taking turns to clean the toliet), or assigning your roommates to get stuff for groceries. In the time I had, I managed to create a simple chores app with a number of functions to add chores, create users, and save chores per users. Next steps would be creating the group function for users, so multiple users can share the same chores list (like a roommate situation).
